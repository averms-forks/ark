Ivy is a static website generator built in Python. It's small, elegant, and easy to use.

    $ ivy --help

    Usage: ivy [FLAGS] [COMMAND]

      Ivy is a static website generator. It transforms a
      directory of text files into a self-contained website.

    Flags:
      -h, --help          Print the application's help text.
      -v, --version       Print the application's version.

    Commands:
      build               Build the site.
      clear               Clear the output directory.
      init                Initialize a new site directory.
      new                 Create a new node file.
      serve               Run a server on the output directory.
      tree                Print the site's node tree.
      watch               Monitor the site directory and
                          automatically rebuild on changes.

    Command Help:
      help <command>      Print the command's help text.

You can build many different kinds of website using Ivy but it's particularly suited to building project documentation like the documentation you're looking at right now.
