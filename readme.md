# Ivy

Ivy is a static website generator built in Python.

* [Documentation (v2 stable)](http://www.dmulholl.com/docs/ivy/)
* [Documentation (v3 dev)](http://www.dmulholl.com/docs/ivy-dev/)
* [Demo Site](http://www.dmulholl.com/demos/ivy/)

My goal is to keep Ivy as small and simple as possible so I almost certainly won't accept pull requests. Ivy is *extremely* flexible though so there's a very good chance any feature you might want to add can be written as an extension. If you need any extra event or filter hooks to make an extension work just let me know and I'll add them.
